# React Native Intermittent Crash Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in a React Native application where data fetching from a remote API causes intermittent crashes. The crash is not consistent and does not provide a clear error message, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A React Native application fetches data from a remote API using `fetch`. Intermittently, the app crashes after the API call, sometimes even after successfully rendering data. The crash is unpredictable and doesn't reveal a specific error in the console.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
3. Observe the app behavior. It may work correctly for some time and then crash without a clear indication of what went wrong.

## Solution

A solution to address this issue is provided in the `DataFetchSolution.js` file. This solution focuses on improving error handling and providing more informative error messages for debugging purposes.
